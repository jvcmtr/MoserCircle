## Moser's Circle Problem 

simple project trying to solve Moser's Circle Problem 
i saw it on a 3blue1brown youtube channel and tried to solve it on paper. i struggle a little to express the recurciveness of the function in mathematical terms, so i decided to solve it on code.  

The problem: if you define N points in a circle and draw lines connecting all of them, you devided the circle in how many regions
